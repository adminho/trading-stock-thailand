# Trading example codes

This repository collects my example codes in Python for studing in [The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)](http://www.set.or.th/set/mainpage.do) that is developing (__not yet__)

In [indicator.py](indicator.py) file, there are my examples to compute the technical indicators for security including

`ROC, Bollinger Band (BBANDS), daily returns, SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Sharpe ratio,True Range (TR), ATR, Beta, OBV and etc`

I Borrowed some code from
